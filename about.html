    <h1>Hello! I'm Ana</h1>
    <h2><i>Fashion Designer</i></h2>
    <h3>Get to know me</h3>
    <p> My name is Ana Ruan and I am a Fashion Designer from <a href =https://www.udem.edu.mx/en>Udem</a>, Mexico. I also work as an inter as a Design Assistant at Fyltex, which is a company focused on designing clothes for babies, toddlers and kids. I finished my thesis on maternity and nursing clothes with investors which was very exciting because I think it represents how I can work as dynamic, versatile and responsible person. <p/>
    <p class="second-par">In addition to designing clothes, I really like photography. This has led me to exhibit my work in various parts of Monterrey, Mexico. If you ever need someone with my skills for garment design or something related to photography feel free to contact me :)</p>
